## Description <a id= 'Descr'></a>

<hr>

Learning typescript, and tired of fighting to merge pdf docs without paying money or downloading software from some sketchy looking site. 

<br>
<br>

## Installation Instructions <a id= 'Install'></a>

<hr>

Clone the repo, run npm install to install all dependencies. Then run program with the command 'ts-node index.ts' from the root folder.

<br>
<br>

## Usage <a id= 'Use'></a>

<hr>

Once running you will be asked where the folder that houses all files to be merged. Easiest way is to copy/paste the directory path. Otherwise you will need to type it out. This allows the user to choose where to merge pdf files from.
