# PDF-Merger
Because paying Adobe to merge PDFs is a waste.

Learning typescript, and tired of fighting to merge pdf docs without paying money or downloading software from some sketchy looking site. 
Intended to be run through CLI and will not likely have any front end.

fork repo, run npm i to install all dependencies, then run 'ts-node index.ts'
